# Ethics

* Milgram experiment
* ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

* Ethics in Interaction Design

* Ethics in FEPS (ERGO2)

## Milgram Experiment

Lab study on obedience to authority figures.

- Ethical issues and participants rights in question
  - Studies must be approved by ethical committees
  - Participants need to sign informed consent form
- Experimental conditions may affect participants behaviour

## Ethics in Interaction Design

Interaction design involves tasks and people in requirements elicitation and evaluation.

We must consider what tasks are ethically acceptable? We must balance between risks and potential.

Many HCI studies do not involve risks higher than using standard office equipment. They often include privacy issues.

Some higher risks include:

* New hardware
* It may be need to deceive participants
* Simulated electricity tariffs may confuse participants

### Avoid Bias

Consider:

* Order and instructions
* Within-group comparative studies
* Mood factors
* Reward consistently before or after
* Experimenter attitude
* Selecting participants
  * Number of participants
  * Systematic bias due to experimental design
  * Random sampling or selecting a specific population

### Recruiting

Where to recruit:

* Population of end user
* More or less generic
* Friends and colleagues, depending on low-level effect vs awareness

Motivation for this:

* Subjects can be paid, given food, enter a draft, or compensated based upon performance in the study
* Importance of the study: ecological validity

How to recruit:

* Generic ads
* Generic and screening or group assignment
* Snowball sampling

## Ethics and Research Governance Online in FEPS

ERGO2 requires two components in application:

* Completed 'Submission Questionnaire' form for insurance
* Completed application form with appendices and any supporting documents

A study should not commence before approval has been received.

### Pre-study

#### Characterise the proposed participants

Identify where participants are from, or the group(s) to which they belong.
Identify the relationship (if any) between the investigator(s) and the participants

#### Describe the approach

How will participants or prospective participants be approached (e.g., face to face in a caf√©; notices on walls and doors;  e-mail; named circulation list; Facebook)
Explain how you will obtain the information you need in order to approach them 

#### Describe how inclusion and/or exclusion criteria will be applied

Describe how participants will be selected or accepted from those who express an interest in participating
Clearly identify the criteria which will be used to include and/or exclude prospective participants

#### Describe how participants will decide whether to take part

Describe when and how participants will be given participant information
Indicate how long participants have to decide
Indicate how informed consent will be obtained
Indicate when and how participants are accepted

### During Study

Describe the study procedures as they will be experienced by participants.

### Post-study

Describe how, when and where the data will be stored, processed, and eventually destroyed.
