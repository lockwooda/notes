# Qualitative Methods

The user is the fundamental unit, not the technology or the product.

User behaviour is variable and user intentions may not be apparent from actions.
We need as much context as possible, hence contextual inquiry

## Contextual Inquiry

Establish context.

* Where is it?
* Activities undertaken in space
* Tools used in activity
* How people interact/work together
* Organisational structure
* Cultural influences

Gives us hints for requirements for design process

* What are the problems people face in their task?
  * Are there problems with existing products people are using?
  * Are there problems with existing user experiences? 
  * What are the causes of these problems? 
* Identify the assumptions people make
* Observe peopleâ€™s actions and practices
* Who are your users?
* What are their tasks?

A contextual inquiry informs the requirements specification
