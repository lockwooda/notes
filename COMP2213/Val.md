# Values

Values: Things we care about

Difficult to conceive of any problem UX designers might be interest in that would not deeply implicate human values.

* Universal values
* Cultural values
  * Spirituality
  * Democracy

Consider values for better products, commercial success, socially-desirable outcomes (e.g. better public health thru wellbeing technology)

## Contextual Values

Some values are tied to specific activities
“To me, if you are exercising and trying to get fitter it should be for you and not because you want more likes on social media.”

## Device-Centric Values

Some values relate to the device/artefact itself

* Accuracy
* Consent
* Privacy
* Beauty

## Value-Sensitive Design

Can use the 'integrative tri-partite methodology':

* Conceptual
  * Articulate stakeholders and their values
* Empirical
  * Research studies to inform understanding of values, need and practices
* Technical
  * Analysis of usage of rlated technologies, design of systems to support identified values

### Challenges

Bounded rationality

Limited knowledge

Value heterogeneity

## Summary

* Values are diverse
* Values drive human action, aspiration
* Activities may impact multiple values
* Users are not always aware of how an activity affects their values
