# Models, Metaphors and Assumptions

Understand the problem space

* What do you want to create?
* What are your assumptions?
* Will it achieve what you hope it will?

How to analyse a problem space

* Are there problems with an existing product/task/process/experience?
* Why do we think there are problems?
* Whats the job to be completed?
* How could we overcome the problems, but still do the job?
* How do those ideas support/change/extend existing UX?

## Conceptual Models

An account of how a system works

* Orientate
  * Allows design team to ask questions
* Open-mind
  * Prevent design team being too narrowly focused too early on
* Common ground
  * Agree set of common terms

### Formation of Conceptual Models

* Metaphors and analogies
* Concepts that people are exposed to thru product
* Relationships and mappins between these concepts

### First steps of a conceptual model

* What will the users be doing when carrying out their task?
  * Interacting through
* How will the system support these?
* What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate?
* What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use?
  * Interacting with

### Interface Metaphors

Interface designed to be similar to physical entity but with own properties

* Based on activity, object, or combination of both
* Exploit user's familiar knowledge, helping to understand unfamiliar
* Enables users to leverage knowledge to understand more aspects of unfamiliar functionality

#### Benefits

* Learning systems easier
* Helps users develop working model that matches model of designers
* Makes technology accessible

#### Problems

* Break conventional/cultural rules
* Constrains designers in the way a problem space is conceptualised

## Interaction Types

* Instructing
  * Tell system what to do
  * Quick and efficient
* Conversing
  * Interact as if having a conversation
  * From voice menus to natural language
* Manipulation
  * Dragging, selecting, opening, closingg, zooming etc...
* Direct Manipulation
  * Continuous representation of objects and actions of interest
  * Buttons, physical actions instead of commands
  * Resizing a graphical shape
* Exploring
  * Moving thru virual/physical environments
