# Participatory Design

Users can't always articulate needs and ideas for improvement in words
Participatory design has methods and ways to help users communicate their ideas and impressions.

Users don't always know what they want, but they are experts in their own domain.

## Core Ideas

Involve users from the very beginning.

* Interviews, focus groups, prototyping
* Gives people a genuine say
* Co-design
