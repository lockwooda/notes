# Prototyping

* Evaluation and feedback central to interaction design
* Stakeholders can see and interact with a prototype more easily than document or drawing
* You can test ideas out for yourself
* Encourages reflection

Low-fidelity prototyping uses a medium which is unlike final medium, such as paper or cardboard. It is quick, cheap and easily changed. Some examples are sketches of screens, task sequences, post-it notes, storyboards, and 'Wizard-of-Oz'.

High-fidelity prototyping is closer to final product. Looks more like final system that low-fidelity version.
